Record a one second audio sample that is seamlessly added to a sequencer. The user can adjust playback speed and direction, sample start point, 
intervals between individual sequence steps, and amplitude modulation for each sequence step.
The UI is a collection of custom SVG sliders and buttons.

This a fully browser-based version of [this project](https://github.com/jmartin432/the-ampulancer).
which I originally created while working toward a Certificate in Creative Coding at Portland
Community College.
